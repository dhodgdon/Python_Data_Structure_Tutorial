# Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial. Every Python programmer should understand the following data structures:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
